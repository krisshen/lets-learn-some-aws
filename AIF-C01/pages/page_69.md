## Question #69

 An education provider is building a question and answer application that uses a generative AI model to explain complex concepts. The education provider wants to automatically change the style of the model response depending on who is asking the question. The education provider will give the model the age range of the user who has asked the question.

Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST implementation effort?

- A. Fine-tune the model by using additional training data that is representative of the various age ranges that the application will support.

- B. Add a role description to the prompt context that instructs the model of the age range that the response should target.

- C. Use chain-of-thought reasoning to deduce the correct style and complexity for a response suitable for that user.

- D. Summarize the response text depending on the age of the user so that younger users receive shorter responses.
