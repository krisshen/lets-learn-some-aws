## Question #64

 A research company implemented a chatbot by using a foundation model (FM) from Amazon Bedrock. The chatbot searches for answers to questions from a large database of research papers.

How can the company improve the performance of the chatbot?

- A. Use few-shot prompting to define how the FM can answer the questions.

- B. Use domain adaptation fine-tuning to adapt the FM to complex scientific terms.

- C. Change the FM inference parameters.

- D. Clean the research paper data to remove complex scientific terms.
