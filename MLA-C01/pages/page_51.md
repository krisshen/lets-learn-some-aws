## Question #51

A company has deployed an ML model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions in real time in a banking application.

The model uses Amazon SageMaker Asynchronous Inference. Consumers are reporting delays in receiving the inference results.

An ML engineer needs to implement a solution to improve the inference performance. The solution also must provide a notification when a deviation in model quality occurs.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Use SageMaker real-time inference for inference. Use SageMaker Model Monitor for notifications about model quality.
- B. Use SageMaker batch transform for inference. Use SageMaker Model Monitor for notifications about model quality.
- C. Use SageMaker Serverless Inference for inference. Use SageMaker Inference Recommender for notifications about model quality.
- D. Keep using SageMaker Asynchronous Inference for inference. Use SageMaker Inference Recommender for notifications about model quality.
