## Question #83

A company wants to reduce the cost of its containerized ML applications. The applications use ML models that run on Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda functions, and an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster. The EC2 workloads and ECS workloads use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes to save predictions and artifacts.

An ML engineer must identify resources that are being used inefficiently. The ML engineer also must generate recommendations to reduce the cost of these resources.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?

- A. Create code to evaluate each instance's memory and compute usage.
- B. Add cost allocation tags to the resources. Activate the tags in AWS Billing and Cost Management.
- C. Check AWS CloudTrail event history for the creation of the resources.
- D. Run AWS Compute Optimizer.
